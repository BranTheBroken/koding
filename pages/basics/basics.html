                    <p>The environment is quite literally everything installed on your machine which can affect either the development

                    <p>A data type or simply type is an attribute of data which tells the

                          data types are integer numbers (of varying sizes), Floating-point numbers (which approximate real numbers), 
                          characters and Booleans</p>

                    <p>Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a
                         way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly . 
                         Variables can be considered as containers for information</p>

                    <p>Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler.
                         Keywords are part of the syntax and they cannot be used as an identifier or variables.</p>

                    <p>An operator in a programming language is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform 
                        specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result.</p>

                <div class="ele-content">
                    <p>Conditional statements, conditional expressions and conditional constructs are features of a programming
                         language, which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates
                          to true or false.</p>

                    <p> A loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is reached. An operation is done, such as getting
                         an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.</p>

                    <p>An array is a data structure, which can store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type. 
                        An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection
                         of variables of the same type.

                         Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>
